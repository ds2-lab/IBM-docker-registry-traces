# IBM-docker-registry-traces

Our trace dataset is part of our USENIX FAST '18 paper [Improving Docker Registry Design based on Production Workload Analysis](https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast18/presentation/anwar).
Traces were obtained by collecting long-span production-level traces from five datacenters in IBM Cloud container registry service during 2017. The traces and trace player tool are further described in the README.

The dataset is publicly available at the following URL:
